This repo contains the pytorch SKEL loader and the code to align it to SMPL sequences.

SKEL is a parametric body shape and skeleton model. Its pose parameter lets you change the body shape and its pose parameter lets you pose the skeleton in an anatomically plausible way. Given shape and pose parameters, SKEL returns joint locations, a body mesh, and a skeleton mesh. SKEL is differentiable and can be fit to various data like motion capture or SMPL sequences.

## Installation

### Set up the environment
Clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/MarilynKeller/SKEL
cd SKEL
```

Create a virtual environment and install the SKEL package
```
pip install -U pip   
python3.8 -m venv skel_venv
source skel_venv/bin/activate
pip install git+https://github.com/mattloper/chumpy 
pip install -e .
```

### Downloading SKEL
Create an account on https://skel.is.tue.mpg.de/ (Necessary for the download to work).

Then download the SKEL model from the download page with the "Download Models" button.
Extract the downloaded folder and edit the file `SKEL/skel/config.py` to specify the folder containing the downloaded SKEL model folder: `skel_folder = '/path/to/skel_models_v1.0`


To test the SKEL model, run:
``` 
python quickstart.py 
```
This runs the forward pass of SKEL and saves the output as separated body and skeleton meshes.


### Aitviewer

If you want to run the Demos, you will also need our aitviewer fork for visualization:

```
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/MarilynKeller/aitviewer-skel.git
cd aitviewer-skel 
pip install -e .
```

Edit then the file `aitviewer/aitviewer/aitvconfig.yaml` to point to the SKEL folder:

```skel_models: "/path/to/skel_models_v1.0"```

### SMPL and Mesh package
If you want to run an alignment to SMPL, you need to download the SMPL model.
First, create an account on https://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de/.
Then download this file: SMPL_python_v.1.1.0.zip from the download page. And run:

```
cd ../SKEL
python scripts/setup_smpl.py /path/to/SMPL_python_v.1.1.0.zip  
```

For visualizing the fitting process you need the MPI mesh package, you can install it with the following line:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/MPI-IS/mesh.git  
```

## Demos

### Pose parameters
Visualize the effects of the pose parameters of SKEL:

```
python examples/skel_poses.py --gender male
```

![]()
<img src="assets/pose_demo.png" alt="Image Description" style="width: 50%;" />

### Shape space
Vizualize the shape space:

```
python examples/skel_betas.py --gender female 
```

### Rigging
Visualize the skinning weights of the skin and bones to the SKEL kinematic tree:


```
python examples/skel_rigging.py --gender female  
```
<img src="assets/rigging_demo.png" alt="Vizu of SKEL skinning weights" style="width: 400px;" />


### SKEL sequence
Visualize a SKEL sequence. You can find a sample SKEL motion in `skel_models_v1.0/sample_motion/ ` and the corresponding SMPL motion.

```
python examples/skel_sequence.py /path/to/skel_models_v1.x/sample_motion/01_01_poses_skel.pkl -z 
```

To visualize the SMPL sequence alongside : 
```
python examples/skel_sequence.py /path/to/skel_models_v1.0/sample_motion/01_01_poses_skel.pkl -z --smpl_seq /path/to/skel_models_v1.0/sample_motion/01_01_poses.npz
```

## Aligning SKEL to SMPL sequences

SKEL can be aligned to SMPL sequences. You can download SMPL sequences from the [AMASS](https://amass.is.tue.mpg.de/) Download page, and selecting the `SMPL+H G` sequences.

Here is the command to run the alignment:
```
python examples/align_to_SMPL.py /path/to/AMASS/CMU/01/01_01_poses.npz -F 
```

## Quickstart

For a minimal use, you will have to follow the install instructions in [Set up the environment](#set-up-the-environment) and [Downloading SKEL](#downloading-skel).

To test the SKEL model, you can then run:
``` 
python quickstart.py 
```
This runs the forward pass of SKEL and saves the output as separated body and skeleton meshes.

You can then try to change the SKEL parameters knowing the following. SKEL is controled by two parameters:

- `betas` controls the shape of the body (tall, small, skinny, etc...). It is a vector of size 10. The values should remain between -2 and 2. The first value of the vector roughly controls the height, the second value the weight.

- `pose` controls the body pose. It is a vector of size 46, most values are angles expressed in radian, and can vary between -3.14 and 3.14. You can see which of the 46 parameters controls which body articulation [here](https://github.com/MarilynKeller/SKEL/blob/21e1b6aad914cc2910d12cf2715784ef90c5f137/skel/kin_skel.py#L29) .

SKEL(beta, pose) yields:
- A skeleton 3D mesh
- A body mesh
- Anatomical joint locations

The rest of this readme will let you setup our SKEL vizualizer and run some demo code. We hope you enjoy our work!


## Installation

### Set up the environment
Clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/MarilynKeller/SKEL
cd SKEL
```

Create a virtual environment and install the SKEL package
```
pip install -U pip   
python3.8 -m venv skel_venv
source skel_venv/bin/activate
pip install git+https://github.com/mattloper/chumpy 
pip install -e .
```

### Downloading SKEL
Create an account on https://skel.is.tue.mpg.de/ (Necessary for the download to work).

Then download the SKEL model from the download page with the "Download Models" button.
Extract the downloaded folder and edit the file `SKEL/skel/config.py` to specify the folder containing the downloaded SKEL model folder: `skel_folder = '/path/to/skel_models_v1.0`


Below, we explain how to set up the visualizer for SKEL (only supported on Linux and Mac), and run some example code.

### Aitviewer

If you want to run the Demos, you will also need our aitviewer fork for visualization:

```
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/MarilynKeller/aitviewer-skel.git
cd aitviewer-skel 
pip install -e .
```

Edit then the file `aitviewer/aitviewer/aitvconfig.yaml` to point to the SKEL folder:

```skel_models: "/path/to/skel_models_v1.0"```

### SMPL and MPI Mesh package

! Note that the MPI mesh package is only supported on Linux systems. If you are not on Linux, you will have to comment out the code depending on the package psbody.mesh and code your own visualization.

If you want to run an alignment to SMPL, you need to download the SMPL model.
First, create an account on https://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de/.
Then download this file: SMPL_python_v.1.1.0.zip from the download page. And run:

```
cd ../SKEL
python scripts/setup_smpl.py /path/to/SMPL_python_v.1.1.0.zip  
```

For visualizing the fitting process you need the MPI mesh package, you can install it with the following line:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/MPI-IS/mesh.git  
```
Note that the mesh package is only supported on Linux, but it is only necessary for the visualization of the fitting processes.

## Demos

### Pose parameters
Visualize the effects of the pose parameters of SKEL:

```
python examples/skel_poses.py --gender male
```

```

<img src="assets/skel_kin_tree.png" alt="Vizu of SKEL kin tree" style="width: 400px;" />

You can see a visual of the joint ids [here](assets/skel_kin_tree_nb.jpg) and their names and the list of degrees of freedom [here](skel/kin_skel.py)

### SKEL sequence
Visualize a SKEL sequence. You can find a sample SKEL motion in `skel_models_v1.0/sample_motion/ ` and the corresponding SMPL motion.

```
python examples/skel_sequence.py /path/to/skel_models_v1.x/sample_motion/01_01_poses_skel.pkl -z 
```

To visualize the SMPL sequence alongside : 
```
python examples/skel_sequence.py /path/to/skel_models_v1.0/sample_motion/01_01_poses_skel.pkl -z --smpl_seq /path/to/skel_models_v1.0/sample_motion/01_01_poses.npz
```

## Aligning SKEL to SMPL sequences

SKEL can be aligned to SMPL sequences. You can download SMPL sequences from the [AMASS](https://amass.is.tue.mpg.de/) Download page, and selecting the `SMPL+H G` sequences.

Here is the command to run the alignment:
```
python examples/align_to_SMPL.py /path/to/AMASS/CMU/01/01_01_poses.npz -F 
```

## Aligning SKEL's skin to another skeleton model joint locations

If you have another skeleton model, you can define the mapping between your skeleton model joints and SKEL's joint and optimize SKEL.shape and pose in consequence to obtain a skin mesh that fits your skeleton model.

```
python examples/fit2joints.py 
```
